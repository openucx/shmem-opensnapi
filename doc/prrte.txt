Using PRRTE as launcher
=======================

PRRTE is the server-side of PMIx.  It can be used instead of Open-MPI
as the launcher.

Sample author config
--------------------

    .../configure \
        --with-tm \
        --prefix=/path/to/install/prrte \
        --with-pmix=/path/to/install/pmix

OSSS-UCX's oshrun command will detect PRRTE's prun command and use it
instead of mpiexec.

In case of problems, the environment variable OSHRUN_DEBUG can be set
to y|1 to provide debugging output during oshrun start-up for
detection of PRRTE/Open-MPI.
