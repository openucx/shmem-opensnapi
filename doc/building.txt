Prerequisites
=============

PMIx
====

v1.2.x, or newer, release; or from github master:

    PMIx      : https://github.com/pmix/pmix/

Sample author config
--------------------

    .../configure --prefix=/path/to/install/pmix

UCX
===

Tested with all releases and from github master:

    UCX       : https://github.com/openucx/ucx/

If you want to build threading support, UCX should be installed with

    --enable-mt

SHCOLL
======

The OpenSHMEM Collectives Library.

Tested with github master:

    SHCOLL    : https://github.com/tonycurtis/OpenSHMEM-Collective-Routines

SHCOLL is also bundled with the OSSS-UCX distribution to avoid
requiring an external installation, and will be used by default.

Sample author config
--------------------

    .../configure \
        --prefix=/path/to/install/shcoll

OpenMPI
=======

For PMIx-aware "mpiexec" launcher:

    OpenMPI downloads : https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/

Sample author config
--------------------

    .../configure \
        --prefix=/path/to/install/openmpi \
        --with-knem \
        --with-ucx=/path/to/install/ucx \
        --with-tm

Combinations
============

For all users, any version of UCX is fine.

The interaction with most impact is that of PMIx and Open-MPI:

  o For end-users, the most stable combinations are
      o PMIx 1.2.5 and Open-MPI 2.1.3
      o PMIx 2.1.1 and Open-MPI 3.1.0
  o For developers, the github master versions throughout will track
    all the latest updates.

A PRRTE-based launcher is in development, but as PRRTE is in flux,
this will not be documented here for now, see prrte.txt for more
information.

Building Sequence
=================

1. In the top-level source directory, run ./autogen.sh

2. You can build this package either in-source-tree or
   out-of-source-tree

3. configure script can be told where PMIx and UCX live, and other
   options

   Sample author config
   --------------------

   .../configure \
       --prefix=/path/to/install/osss-ucx \
       --with-pmix=/path/to/install/pmix \
       --with-ucx=/path/to/install/ucx \
       --with-shcoll=/path/to/install/shcoll \
       --enable-debug \
       --enable-logging \
       --enable-threads
       --with-heap-size=8G
   
4. make install
