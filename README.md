Introduction
============

OpenSHMEM-SNAPI is an open source research project based on the [OSSS
OpenSHMEM](https://github.com/openshmem-org/osss-ucx) library implementation.
This software is developed under the [UCFâ€™s Open Smart Network Application
Programming Interface
(OpenSNAPI)](https://www.ucfconsortium.org/projects/opensnapi/) project. It
enables Smart Networking Adapters to provide fast and granular access to large
datasets in order to deliver higher application performance for
latency-sensitive applications and analytic workflows.

The project adds two major components to the OSSS OpenSHMEM implementation.
 * The OpenSNAPI low-overhead persistent storage server is a stand alone component
 based on [Open UCX communication library](https://www.openucx.org).
 * The OpenSHMEM fspace API implements a client for the OpenSNAPI storage server.

The OpenSNAPI storage server tested on Mellanox Bluefield software development
platfrom with NVDIMM-N memory installed. The OpenSHMEM fspace client API was
tested on the Marvell ThunderX2 platform.

* Installation instructions can be found here [contrib](contrib)
* Detailed description of the API and the project are found in the publication.
